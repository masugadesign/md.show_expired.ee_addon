h1. MD Show Expired

Show (and filter) entries that have an expiration date on the Edit page in the ExpressionEngine Control Panel

h2. Info

Developed by Ryan Masuga, http://masugadesign.com

This extension allows you to easily see what entries are expired – or set to expire in the future. A brand new dropdown is inserted in the search area of the Edit page so you can also filter by entries that are expired. Very handy if you use EE’s built in entry expiration!
